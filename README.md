# Gavel
*It's okay to judge a book by its cover.*

Gavel is a mobile app that allows a user to take a picture of a book cover and instantly obtain information about the novel such as reviews, ratings, and descriptions. Gavel works on iPhone and Android by utilizing the power of PhoneGap. The app also harnesses Google's reverse image search functionality in order to intelligently determine the identities of various books.
