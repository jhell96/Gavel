## I suggest switching to https://github.com/shaithana/cordova-plugin-wezka-nativecamera which has a superior UI. I have an active fork at https://github.com/mWater/cordova-plugin-wezka-nativecamera until some fixes are merged.

cordova-plugin-camera-foreground
==========================

This is a fork of the official camera plugin from Apache.

It uses a custom activity to run in the foreground in Android to prevent Cordova from being killed.

It is adapted from https://code.google.com/p/foreground-camera-plugin/

To install this plugin, follow the [Command-line Interface Guide](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface).

If you are not using the Cordova Command-line Interface, follow [Using Plugman to Manage Plugins](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide_plugin_ref_plugman.md.html).
